# counting-ocean-particles
This repository contains a set of codes, in the form of easy interactive Jupyter Notebooks, to process data on marine suspended particles collected with different sensors (i.e. LISST-100x, LISST-200x at the moment). It was developed with the purpose of creating standard processing procedures for data collected *in-situ* by the Suspended Material and Seabed Monitoring and Modelling (SUMO) group of the Institute of Natural Sciences of Belgium.
